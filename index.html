           The Church of the Flying Spaghetti Monster has the answer for you.</p>

            <h2>The creation story</h2>
            <p id="p-creation-story">In pastafarianism, we believe that the universe was 
                                     created by our Lord the Flying Spaghetti Monster only 
                                     a few thousand years ago, and that it looked much like 
                                     it does today. But, for reasons unknown to us, He made 
                                     it appear as though our universe is billions of years 
                                     old instead the thousands it really is. Every time a 
                                     researcher carries out an experiment that appears to 
                                     confirm one of these "scientific theories" supporting 
                                     an old earth and evolution we can be sure that the FSM 
                                     is there, modifying the data with his Noodly Appendage. 
                                     We don't know why He does this but we believe He does, 
                                     that is our Faith.</p>

        <h1>Why should you become a pastafarian?</h1>
            <p id="p-why-join">Pastafarianism is an inclusive religion that doesn't enforce much 
                               on you as a follower. Some believers truly believe in the FSM and others purely 
                               think it is satire, but all are welcome to join the Church of the Flying Spaghetti Monster.</p>
